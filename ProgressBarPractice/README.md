# Progress Bar with Promise and ES6

This project is a simple implementation of a progress bar using Promises and ES6 JavaScript, designed to practice real DOM manipulation. Additionally, the project uses SASS for styling.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to practice manipulating the DOM using vanilla JavaScript (ES6), focusing on building a progress bar that simulates a loading process using JavaScript Promises. The layout and styles are handled with SASS to practice using a CSS preprocessor.

## Features

- **Progress Bar Simulation**: A dynamic progress bar that fills based on a simulated loading process using Promises.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Real-time DOM manipulation with ES6 JavaScript to update the progress bar as the Promise resolves.
- **SASS for Styling**: Styles written in SASS for efficient and organized CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling DOM manipulation and Promises.
- **SASS**: For writing modular and maintainable CSS.
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the project.

## File Structure

```bash
.
├── progressbar.html     # The main HTML file for the progress bar
├── index.js             # JavaScript file containing the logic for the progress bar
└── style.scss           # SASS file for styling
```
